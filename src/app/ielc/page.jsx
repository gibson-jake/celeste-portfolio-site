                            As we approach the end of the design journey, it's time to look back and see how well the
                            product has met its goals. The website and brand identity for IELC have been a hit, with a
                            noticeable increase in applications since its launch. <HiddenBreaks/> In just the first
                            month, we
                            received 42 applications— an impressive 320% increase! Now, the site serves as a go-to
                            application portal, seamlessly bringing together all previous platforms. This not only
                            boosted
                            applications and engagement but also solidified the company's reputation for reliability
                            and trustworthiness.

                            Looking back on this project, I've realized just how crucial it is to adapt and customize my
                            product to fit both my client's needs and the expectations of our users. By putting
                            functionality first and creating a strong brand identity, I was able to find success in the
                            business
                            world. <HiddenBreaks/> Along the way, I also learned a lot about the iterative process of
                            design
                            and how
                            important it is to keep refining and improving. <HiddenBreaks/> Overall, this experience has
                            given me a
                            deeper understanding of how every design element plays a role in shaping the final outcome
                            of a
                            project.

                            As I look ahead, I'm eager to explore some exciting enhancements for the site. To start,
                            I'll
                            prioritize improving accessibility features to ensure every visitor can easily navigate and
                            use
                            the platform. One example would be incorporating a dark mode for the site to cater to
                            varying
                            needs and preferences. <HiddenBreaks/> Additionally, I plan to amplify the voices of parents
                            whose
                            children have benefited from the program by sharing their real-life stories. These updates
                            are
                            all about ensuring the site continues to evolve and meet the needs of our users, solidifying
                            our company's reputation as a reliable resource.
