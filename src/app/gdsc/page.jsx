                            As the Vice President and Design Director of the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), I
                            undertook the challenge of redesigning our club's website. With our chapter being one of the
                            most well-known in the Google community, it was essential that our new website <Bold text={

                            developers, was assigned the task of programming the new site. <Bold

                        content={<>Initially, I felt anxious about redesigning our club's website in just two weeks by
                            myself. The tight timeline was challenging, but I was motivated to create something
                            meaningful for my club and community. As Vice President and Design Director, I was committed
                            to showcasing everything our club offers. This dedication guided me throughout the process.
                            Drawing on my past design experiences, I focused on what I excel at: design.<br/><br/>Throughout
                            this process, I've learned that design is a journey. Each small step is essential to
                            reaching larger goals. Ongoing learning allows me to create better designs for users. I
                            stayed focused on my end goal: crafting meaningful and useful designs. Every detail, from
                            buttons to font sizes, is tailored to the audience—it's all about user-focused design. I've
                            learned to identify what works and what doesn't, and <Bold text={"the best part is that the learning is continuous."}/>
